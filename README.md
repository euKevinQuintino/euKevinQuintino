## Hey there!
### I'm Kevin, I design and develop *user experiences*.

Web development has always captivated me. Designing and developing interfaces that please and support their users, **providing them with a memorable experience**, brings me enormous personal satisfaction.

**In my free time I like** to watch eSports; to play instruments; to watch videos, movies, series and documentaries; to listen to music; to read books and articles; to draw and to philosophize about anything.

### How can I help you? Contact me.
